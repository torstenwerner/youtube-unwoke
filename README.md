# Unwoke YouTube

This is an extension for Chromium based browsers such as Brave or Chrome.
It automatically hides the so called "clarify box" below some videos.

1. Create an empty directory.
2. Download the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/torstenwerner/youtube-unwoke/releases) into this directory.
3. Optional step: change the extension of the file from crx to zip so that the final name is youtube-unwoke.zip.
4. Unpack the file.
5. Navigate to [extensions settings](chrome://extensions/)
6. Enable "Developer mode" (usually a toggle in the top right)
7. Click the button "Load unpacked" and choose the directory.
8. Optionally disable "Developer mode". But now you have to review the extension. Click the menu at the right of the extension and confirm that you want to keep it.
